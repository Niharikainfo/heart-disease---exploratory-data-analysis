# heart-disease---exploratory-data-analysis
Welcome to the Heart Disease: Exploratory Data Analysis repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for exploring and analyzing heart disease data using Python.
# Introduction
Heart disease is a critical health issue that affects millions of people worldwide. This repository uses Python for exploratory data analysis (EDA) to explore and analyze heart disease data. The goal is to gain valuable insights into the dataset, understand the factors associated with heart disease, and provide solutions to address this significant health concern.

# Problem Statement
The problem revolves around analyzing a heart disease dataset to understand the factors and characteristics that contribute to heart disease. By exploring the dataset and performing EDA, we aim to identify significant features and patterns that can help prevent, diagnose, and treat heart disease effectively. The key challenges include:

Identifying the most influential risk factors and variables associated with heart disease.
Uncovering hidden patterns and dependencies within the dataset.
Validating the significance of relationships between variables.
Deriving actionable insights and recommendations for improved cardiovascular health.
